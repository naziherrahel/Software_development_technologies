## Part A — Waterfall Planning

### Task A1: Requirements and Stages

> **Instructions:** Describe each Waterfall stage for your assigned system. Write 2–3 sentences per stage.
> 

> 
> 

> ⚠️ **Important Rule:** After completing the *Requirements* stage, a new requirement will be introduced. You must **not** modify any previously written content. This demonstrates the rigidity of the Waterfall model.
> 

#### 1. System Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**

[Write 2–3 sentences describing what the system must do]

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

[Write 2–3 sentences describing quality attributes like performance, usability, security]

---

<aside>
⚠️

**🔒 NEW REQUIREMENT INTRODUCED**

[Instructor will provide the new requirement here]

**Waterfall Rule:** You cannot go back and modify the Requirements section above.

</aside>

---

#### 2. Design

[Write 2–3 sentences describing the system architecture and design approach]

#### 3. Implementation

[Write 2–3 sentences describing the development and coding phase]

#### 4. Testing

[Write 2–3 sentences describing testing strategies and validation]

#### 5. Deployment

[Write 2–3 sentences describing how the system will be released and deployed]

---

### Task A2: System Diagram

> **Instructions:** Create a simple architecture diagram using [**draw.io**](http://draw.io) that shows:
> 

> • Main system components
> 

> • Basic data or control flow
> 

> 
> 

> **Guidelines:**
> 

> • Rectangles + arrows are sufficient
> 

> • UML notation is not required
> 

> • Clarity is more important than detail
> 

**System Architecture Diagram:**

[Insert your [draw.io](http://draw.io) diagram image here or link to it]

**Diagram Description:**

[Write 2–3 sentences explaining your diagram]

---

## Part B — Agile Planning

### Task B1: User Stories (Sprint 1)

> **Instructions:** Define Sprint 1 by writing three user stories using the template:
> 

> 
> 

> `As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit].`
> 

> 
> 

> User stories must:
> 

> • Describe user-visible behavior
> 

> • Avoid technical implementation details
> 

#### Sprint 1 User Stories

**User Story 1:**

As a [user],

I want [action],

so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

---

**User Story 2:**

As a [user],

I want [action],

so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

---

**User Story 3:**

As a [user],

I want [action],

so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

---

### Task B2: Handling Change

> **Instructions:** The new requirement introduced earlier is now added to your Agile backlog.
> 

> • Write it as a **new user story**
> 

> • Place it in **Sprint 2 (Backlog)**
> 

> • No existing work needs to be changed
> 

#### Sprint 2 (Backlog)

**User Story 4 — New Requirement:**

As a [user],

I want [action related to the new requirement],

so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

<aside>
✅

**Agile Flexibility:** Notice how the new requirement was easily added to the backlog without disrupting completed work.

## Part C — Reflection

> **Instructions:** Write 3–5 sentences answering each question below.
> 

> There is no single correct answer. Evaluation focuses on reasoning and clarity.
> 

### Question 1: Waterfall Rigidity

**What problem occurred when the requirement was added in the Waterfall model?**

[Write your answer here: 3–5 sentences]

---

### Question 2: Agile Adaptation

**How did Agile handle the same situation differently?**

[Write your answer here: 3–5 sentences]

---

### Question 3: Model Suitability

**Which model would be more suitable for rapidly changing systems, and why?**

[Write your answer here: 3–5 sentences]

---
