# Course Introduction & General Rules
[the course transformation demo](https://naziherrahel.github.io/Software_development_technologies/)

Welcome to this course.

This course is **highly practical and implementation-oriented**. You will work hands-on with real tools and workflows commonly used in industry, focusing not only on *how* things work, but *why* they are used.

---

## 1. Course Overview

The goal of this course is to help you:

* Understand modern **software development workflows**
* Gain hands-on experience with **version control systems** and **containerization**
* Learn how development, deployment, and collaboration fit together in real-world projects

Rather than isolated exercises, you will **incrementally build and reuse the projects across multiple labs**. Each lab adds a new layer of understanding and tooling.

This approach reflects how real software systems are developed and maintained.

---

## 2. Course Nature & Learning Philosophy

This is a **practice-first course**.

* Most learning happens through **labs and exercises**, not memorization
* Concepts are introduced when they are needed
* You are expected to **run, modify, and understand code**

You are *allowed* to use provided reference code, but you are **responsible for understanding what you submit**.

If asked, you should be able to explain:

* What the code does
* Why specific tools or commands are used

---

## 3. Tools & Environment

You will work on your **own local machine**.

Supported operating systems:

* Windows
* Linux
* macOS

Main tools used throughout the course:

* Python
* Git (version control)
* Docker (containerization)

---

## 4. Course Outline (High-Level)

The detailed course outline may evolve during the semester. However, you can expect the course to cover the following **core themes**:

* Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
* Agile concepts and workflows
* Version control systems (Git)
* Containerization and application packaging (Docker)
* Practical DevOps-oriented development practices

Each topic will be introduced through **hands-on labs** rather than purely theoretical lectures.

---

## 5. Attendance Policy (Very Important)

Attendance is **mandatory**.

* If you miss **20% or more** of the course sessions, this will result in an **automatic fail**, regardless of grades obtained in other components.
* Attendance may be checked during lectures, labs.

Plan accordingly and communicate early if exceptional circumstances arise.

---

## 6. Presentations Requirement

Each student is required to deliver **three (3) presentations** during the course.

Presentation requirements:

* Duration: **7–10 minutes** each
* Format: **Slides**
* Slides must be **submitted before the class** where the presentation is given

Presentation topics and schedule will be announced during the course.

These presentations are designed to:

* Improve technical communication skills
* Encourage deeper understanding of tools and concepts
* Prepare you for real-world technical discussions

---

## 7. Lab Work & Submissions

Labs are a core component of this course.

For each lab, you are typically expected to submit:

* Code (where applicable)
* Screenshots demonstrating successful execution
* Short written explanations or answers

Instructions for each lab will clearly specify the required deliverables.

---

## 8. Academic Integrity

* All work must be **your own**, unless explicitly stated otherwise
* You may discuss ideas with classmates, but **submitted work must be individual**
* Copying without understanding may result in penalties

If you use external resources, make sure you understand how they work and can explain them.

---

## 9. How to Succeed in This Course

* Attend classes regularly
* Do not rush through labs
* Focus on understanding, not just completing tasks
* Ask questions early when something is unclear
* Treat labs as real engineering exercises, not checklists

---
## 9. Learning Resources & Background Material

In addition to the materials provided during this course, students may find the following resources useful for background study and revision.

### Previous Course Materials (Optional)

The following link contains **labs and lecture materials from a previous iteration of this course**, with a stronger focus on:

* Python programming fundamentals
* General software engineering concepts
* Introductory Agile theory

These materials are **not mandatory**, but they can be helpful if:
* You feel less confident in Python
* You want additional explanations or practice
* You prefer reviewing concepts at your own pace

We are looking forward to working with you this semester.

Approach the course with curiosity, responsibility, and a willingness to experiment.
